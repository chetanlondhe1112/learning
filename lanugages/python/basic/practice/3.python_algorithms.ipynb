    "#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Time Complexity?\n",
    "Time complexity describes how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size (n) increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps in comparing different algorithms to understand which one is more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding Big-O Notation\n",
    "Big-O notation represents the upper bound (worst case) of an algorithm‚Äôs growth rate.\n",

    "    Big-O Notation\tName\tExample\n",
    "    O(1)\tConstant Time\tHash Table Lookups (dict.get())\n",
